## üñ•Ô∏è Local Development Setup

Follow these steps to get your local development environment running.

### Prerequisites

* Node.js (v18+)
* npm or yarn

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone [Your-Repo-URL]
    cd flowstate-talent
    ```
2.  **Install dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Start the development server:**
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    # or
    # yarn dev
    ```
    The application will typically be available at `http://localhost:8080` (as configured in your `vite.config.ts`).

### Database Seeding

The application automatically seeds the local IndexedDB using **Dexie.js** and **MSW** upon initial load via `src/main.tsx`, so you will have dummy data available immediately.
